# Blog-Post-Assignment
This is the Github page for the class, Efficient ML Systems (EECE695D-01).  Students (will) upload a blog post reviewing the paper.

## Guideline for Students
* First, make the folder named `Paper Number_Paper Title_Member1_Member2 (e.g. 0_TACO_HagyeongLee)`. You can use initials of paper title. If there is no optimal initials, then you can skip the paper name (e.g. 0_HagyeongLee).
* Second, you put the markdown file and assests(e.g. figures) in the folder.
* Finally, if you verify that the markdown file is rendering successfully.
